    <h1>Recipe of Kung Pao Chicken with Bell Peppers</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken, 2 tsp. soy sauce, 1 tsp. sherry, and cornstarch in a medium bowl. Stir until the cornstarch
            is no longer visible. Add sesame oil and stir until the chicken is lightly coated.</li>
        <li>Combine broth, vinegar, chile-garlic sauce, and the remaining 1 Tbsp. soy sauce and 1 Tbsp. sherry in a
            small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed carbon-steel wok (or a 12-inch stainless-steel skillet) over high heat until a
            drop of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Swirl in 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil. Add ginger;
            stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Push the ginger slices to the sides and add the chicken in an
            even layer. Cook, undisturbed, until it begins to brown, about 1 minute. Using a metal spatula, stir-fry the
            chicken until lightly browned but not cooked through, about 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Swirl in the remaining 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil. Add bell peppers; stir-fry for 1 minute. Return the chicken to
            the pan along with the reserved sauce; season with salt and stir-fry until the chicken is cooked through, 1
            to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and sprinkle with peanuts.</li>

    </ol>
